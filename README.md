# K-nearest-neighbour-Knn-algorithm
Knn is a supervised ML algorithm use for both Classification and regression
KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition
Simplest Algorithm but Accurate , .which suggests that if you’re similar to your neighbours, then you are one of them.
kNN is often used in search applications where you are looking for similar items, like find items similar to this one
Works on the principle of finding the nearest distance
KNN is a non-parametric learning algorithm, which means that it doesn't assume anything about the underlying data
This is an extremely useful feature since most of the real world data doesn't really follow any theoretical assumption e.g. linear-separability, uniform distribution, etc.
